# ConsoleDownloader
A simple YouTube downloader that works from the console.

Made with convenience and simplicity in mind. As such, you can compile it to a single executable that automatically deals downloading FFmpeg and then deletes it when the task finishes, so only the primary executable is present at all times.
If you are looking for a full-fledged downloader with a UI, I heavily recommend [YouTubeDownloader](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeDownloader).

Compiled binaries are available from the Releases tab.
